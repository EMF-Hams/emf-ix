# Planning dump area

EMF seems so far away... We have plenty of time to plan, don't we???

# High level overview

A few of us network geeks thought we didn't already have enough to do. So naturally we decided to run an internet exchange in 2026. Below is a thrown together list of goals (wishes??).

- Provide local peering between existing networks.
- Provide local peering using [private ranges](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) for those who don't have public ranges.
- Public ASN's preferred but we welcome [private as](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6996). 
- Transit to the internet (GRE tunnels to bare metal servers in London).
- Fully dual stack with a preference towards IPv6. We have a large public IPv6 block we can sub allocate.
- Locally available services; grafana, looking glass, ticket systems etc etc.
- Take care to ensure that we do not interfere with on site EMF network.
